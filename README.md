# OOP Design Paterns in CPP

Design patterns are present in many fields including engineering, architecture, and art.
They provide proven solutions to commonly ocurring problems.
Design patterns aim to facilitate change in software systems,
reducing the effort to include new functionality or update existing ones.

This repository contains the implementation of some design patterns in the `C++` programming language.

The examples and implementation are based on the
[Head First Design Patterns](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992) and
[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/)
books.

The first one follows a more didactic approach and is intended for novice programmers. The latter is the reference book for design patterns. It was written by the *GoF* and is intended for those who have a solid OOP background.

## Project structure
The design patterns examples are classified by the *purpose* criterion.
Therefore, there are three directories: `creationalPatterns`, `structuralPatterns` and `behavioralPatterns`.
Each one contains one subdirectory for an specific design pattern use case.
